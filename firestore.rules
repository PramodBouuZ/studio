/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, where `userId` MUST match the Firebase Auth UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is denormalized into the document path itself (`/users/{userId}`),
 * allowing for simple `isOwner(userId)` checks without additional reads.
