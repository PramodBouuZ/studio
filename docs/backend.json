This path-based ownership model provides strong isolation and simplifies access control, enabling atomic operations and clear authorization logic. The structure allows for secure list operations using path-based rules (QAPs) since each user's data is isolated within their own collection.\n\nAuthorization Independence: This design enforces authorization independence by leveraging path-based ownership. Since user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, access control can be enforced solely based on `request.auth.uid` matching the `userId` without needing to retrieve data from other documents.\n\nQAPs: The design facilitates secure list operations by structurally segregating user data.  Listing documents within `/users/{userId}` only requires checking that `request.auth.uid == userId`, which avoids complex filtering logic in rules and enables efficient queries."
